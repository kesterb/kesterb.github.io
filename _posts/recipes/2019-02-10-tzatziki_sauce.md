I love making a big batch of this tzatziki sauce because it can be used in so
many different ways.  I use in pitas, as salad dressing, as a veggie dip, and
as a topping for baked potatoes.  It's a really versatile sauce!

| Active time | Rest time   | Total Time  |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 20 minutes  | 1 day       | About 1 day |

Ingredients
-----------

- 32 oz plain **Greek Yogurt**
- 2 medium **Cucumbers**, peeled and shredded
- 6 cloves **Garlic**, pressed
- 4 fl. oz. **Olive Oil**
- 2 medium **Lemons**, juiced
- 2 tsp. **Dill**
- Kosher **Salt**
- Fresh ground **Black Pepper**

Directions
----------

1. In a large bowl add the **olive oil** and pressed **garlic**.
2. Add the **lemon juice** and lightly whisk together.
3. In a separate shallow bowl use a fine cheese grater to shred the
**cucumber**.  Put the shredded cucumber in a kitchen or tea towel to remove
most of the liquid.  Allow a few minutes to drain.
4. In the first bowl add the **greek yogurt**, **dill**, **salt**, and **pepper**.  
Whisk the ingredients together and adjust the seasonings to your preference.
5. Using a spatula fold in the shredded **cucumber** until evenly distributed.
6. Place in a storage container and refrigerate for about a day.  This will
allow the garlic to mellow out and the flavors to meld together.
