This is a seriously tasty upgrade to traditional beef stew.  The addition of
bacon and red wine really take this stew to the next level.  I'm making this in
a 6 quart pressure cooker so you may need to scale this accordingly.

| Prep time  | Cook time  | Total Time |
|------------|------------|------------|
| 25 minutes | 65 minutes | 90 minutes |

Ingredients
-----------

- 4 slices **Bacon**, cut into 1 inch sections
- 2 lbs. **Beef stew meat**, cut into 1.5 inch cubes
- 3-4 large **Baking Potatoes**, cut into 1 inch cubes
- 3 large **Carrots**, cut into 1 inch sections
- 3 ribs of **Celery**, sliced into 1/2 inch sections
- 2 large **Shallots**, sliced into 1/8th inch layers
- 4 cloves **Garlic**, diced or pressed
- 2 cups [**Pinot Noir**][pinot], or other suitable red wine
- 2 cups **Beef Stock**
- 2 tbsp. **Tomato Paste**
- 2 tsp. **Worcestershire sauce**
- 3 stems fresh **Rosemary**
- 4 stems fresh **Thyme**
- 3 **Bay Leaves**
- 0.5 cups **All-Purpose Flour**
- 1 tsp. **Cornstarch**
- **Salt** & **Pepper**

Directions
----------

1. Slice up your veggies and meat.
2. In a large bowl combine the **beef stock**, **pinot noir**, **Worcestershire sauce**
and **tomato paste**.  You'll want to have this ready to deglaze the pot in step 5.
3. Coat the **beef** in a mixture of **all-purpose flour**, **salt**, and **pepper**.
4. Set your pressure cooker to saute mode and when it's hot add the **bacon** and
**shallots**.  Cook until the **bacon** is a crunch brown then remove both **bacon** and
**shallots** using a slotted spoon.
5. Brown the flour coated **beef** in the bacon fat in batches.  This will build up
a layer of [fond][deglazing] in the pot, which is desired.  When the last batch of
beef is finishing up add the **garlic** for the last minute.  This should be just
enough to brown the garlic.
6. [Deglaze][deglazing] the pot with the liquid you mixed up in step 2.  Make
sure you add all of the liquid to the pot.
7. Add all of the **beef** and about one-third of the **shallots** to the pot
and put the lid on your pressure cooker.  Set your pressure cooker to manual
mode and turn on high pressure for 10 minutes.  After the timer goes off let
the pressure dissipate for about 5 minutes then open the steam vent.
8. Remove the lid and add the **potatoes**, **carrots**, **celery**, **bacon**,
**rosemary**, **thyme**, **bay leaves**, and remaining **shallots**.  Put the
lid on and close the steam vent.  Set the pot to manual mode again and set the
timer for 15 minutes.  Once the timer goes off let the pot depressurize for
about 10 minutes then open the steam vent.
9. If the stew isn't thick enough mix together one teaspoon of **cornstarch**
and two tablespoons of **water** in a separate bowl.  Then stir this mixture into
the stew.  Repeat as necessary.
10. Season the stew with **salt** and **pepper** to taste.
