This is one of my favorite meals to make in a pressure cooker.  It feels like cheating for such a fancy, tasty meal.  Plus, you have extra wine to enjoy with dinner!

| 15 minutes | 30 minutes | 45 minutes |

Ingredients
-----------

- 1 qt low sodium chicken or veggie stock
- 4 oz shitake mushrooms
- 1.5 lbs mixed mushrooms (cremini, oyster, chanterelle)
- 4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 medium yellow onion, diced
- 2 medium garlic cloves, pressed
- 1.5 cups risotto rice (arborio, or vialone nano)
- 2 tsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp light miso paste
- .75 cups Pinot Grigio
- .25 cups heavy whipping cream
- 1 wedge Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, shredded
- 1 bunch flat parsley, chopped
- Salt and Black Pepper

Directions
----------

1. Wash and de-stem all **mushrooms**.  Cut the **mushroom** heads into bite size pieces.  Put the stems into a microwave safe bowl along with the **stock**.  Microwave the **stock** and **mushroom stems** on high for 5 minutes.
2. Turn on the saute function of your pressure cooker and add the **olive oil** and **butter**, cooking until melted.  Add the **chopped mushrooms**, **salt** and **black pepper** to the pot and saute them until most of the water has evaporated, about 10 minutes.  Add the diced **onion** and continue sauteing for 3-4 minutes.  Add the pressed **garlic**, **soy sauce**, and **miso paste**.  Stir for approximately 1 minute.  Add the **rice** to the pot and stir for about a minute, until the rice turns partially translucent.  Add the **wine** and cook for about a minute.  Strain the **stock** though a mesh screen into the pot.
3. Put the lid onto your pressure cooker and seal the release valve.  Set the unit to manual on low pressure for 5 minutes.  When the timer is up, open the release valve to quick release the pressure.
4. Pour yourself a glass of wine and consume at a reasonable rate.
5. When the unit is depressurized, remove the lid.  Slowly stir in the **heavy cream** and continue stirring until the liquid thickens.  Add about half the **Parmigiano-Reggiano** and half the **parsley** while continuing to stir.
6. Serve in bowls and garnish with more **Parmigiano-Reggiano** and **parsley**.
